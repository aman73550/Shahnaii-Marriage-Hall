To enhance the Shahnaii Marriage Hall landing page with emotional depth and compelling reasons for selection, add the following sections to your React architecture. These integrate the specific feedback and stories found in verified reviews while maintaining the "Modern Opulence" aesthetic.
1. Why Shahnaii? (The Pillars of Excellence)
This section should be a high-end bento grid using gold-bordered cards and ivory text to highlight the venue's core strengths.
 * Customizable Opulence: Shahnaii is renowned for its flexible, budget-friendly plans that allow families to experience grand dinners and daytime functions without financial hindrance.
 * Grand Capacity: The venue features a magnificent, spacious banquet hall and green lawn capable of hosting between 500 to 1,000 guests comfortably.
 * Impeccable Hygiene: A strict code for maintaining cleanliness and hygiene is a core priority, ensuring the safety and comfort of every guest.
 * Seamless Hospitality: With 8 on-site AC and Non-AC guest rooms and a dedicated bridal suite, the venue provides a comfortable sanctuary for the wedding party during pre-ceremony moments.
 * Inclusive Design: The facility is fully equipped with wheelchair-accessible entrances, exits, and parking to ensure every family member can celebrate without barriers.
2. The Human Story (The "Shahnaii Journeys")
Instead of a standard "About" section, use a storytelling component titled "Where Legacies Begin" to connect with users emotionally.
 * The Foundation of New Journeys: Shahnaii has built a reputation as a "trusted choice" for those starting their academic or life journeys in Domariyaganj, offering a vibrant and supportive atmosphere that feels like home.
 * The Siraj Perspective: Local guests like Siraj have highlighted it as a "good place for a wedding with all facilities," emphasizing the dependable and complete nature of the venue.
 * The Wedding Tradition: Having hosted over 25 major events in the last 6 years, the hall has become a staple of the Motiganj Chauraha community, known for its attention to detail and customer-focused approach.
 * Global Flavors, Local Roots: The in-house catering team is praised for blending local and global flavors, creating a "dining experience" that guests specifically highlight as a reason for their 4+ star ratings.
3. Technical Implementation for Stories
Integrate these "Human Stories" using a Parallax Scroll Reveal in React:
// Example Content for the Story Section
const stories = [
  {
    title: "A Trusted Sanctuary",
    text: "For years, Shahnaii has been more than a hall; it's a dependable place where comfort and quality meet affordability.",
    cite: "Justdial Verified Review"
  },
  {
    title: "Inclusive Celebrations",
    text: "Designed so every guest arrives, celebrates, and departs without hassle—regardless of their accessibility needs.",
    cite: "Mandap.com Feature"
  }
];

Next Step: Would you like me to generate the TypeScript interface and Framer Motion code for a "Story Carousel" that displays these human stories with a gold-fade effect?
